# NodeJs-And-Express.js_Assign
Here are some key points about Express.js:

Web Application Framework: Express.js is a lightweight and flexible framework that helps you create web applications and APIs quickly. It is built on top of Node.js and provides a minimal set of features, allowing developers to add functionality as needed.

Routing: Express.js simplifies URL routing. You can define routes for various URLs and HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) and associate them with corresponding functions or middleware to handle requests.

Middleware: Middleware functions in Express.js are functions that have access to the request and response objects. They can be used to perform tasks like authentication, logging, data parsing, etc. Middleware can be added globally or specific to certain routes.

HTTP Methods: Express.js provides methods for handling different HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. This makes it easy to create APIs that follow RESTful principles.

Request and Response: Express.js simplifies working with requests and responses. You can easily access request parameters, headers, and body data. Similarly, you can send responses with different status codes and data formats.

Template Engines: While Express.js itself does not include a built-in template engine, it can be easily integrated with popular template engines like EJS, Pug (formerly Jade), Handlebars, etc., for rendering dynamic views on the server.

Static File Serving: You can use Express.js to serve static files like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and more. This is often useful for building the frontend part of your application.

Middleware Ecosystem: There's a wide range of third-party middleware available for Express.js, allowing you to add various functionalities to your application, such as authentication, logging, compression, and more.
